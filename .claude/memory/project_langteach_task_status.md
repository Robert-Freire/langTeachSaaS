description: Sprint branch name, milestone sequence, and pointers to live state. NOT per-issue status (query GitHub for that).

## Live Tracker: GitHub Issues

GitHub Issues is the single source of truth for task tracking.
**Never trust this file for per-issue status. Always query GitHub.**

Key queries:
- Current sprint issues: `gh issue list --milestone "<milestone-name>" --state open`
- Must-haves: `gh issue list --milestone "<milestone-name>" --label "P1:must" --state open`
- Ready to pick up: `gh issue list --milestone "<milestone-name>" --label "qa:ready" --state open`

**Active sprint branch:** `sprint/post-class-tracking` (created 2026-04-02)
Agents must PR against this branch, not `main`. See CLAUDE.md "Sprint Branch Workflow" section.

## Milestone Sequence (newest first)

| Milestone | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|

## Upcoming Milestones (not yet started)

- Solo Whiteboard: after Listening Comprehension
- Adaptive Replanning: after Post-Class Tracking (audio input, auto-difficulty, course replanning)
- Group Classes: FUTURE
- Phase 2B: Production (caching, usage limits, CI pipeline)
- Phase 3: Growth (student portal, evaluation, content library, payments)

## Task Numbering Convention

Tasks are numbered sequentially within a phase. Branch naming: `task/t<N>-<short-description>`.

## Key Architectural Notes

- Azure Container Apps (not App Service), North Europe region, SWA in West Europe
- ACR: `crlangteachdev.azurecr.io`, OIDC auth (not SP secret)
- Content blocks are typed (vocabulary, exercises, conversation, reading, grammar, homework, freeText, errorCorrection, noticingTask, guidedWriting) with per-type renderers
- Mock-auth e2e: ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=E2ETesting, VITE_E2E_TEST_MODE=true
- Student->Lesson FK is NoAction (SQL Server cascade constraint)
- Deploy freeze: primary mechanism is sprint branch workflow (don't trigger merge action); secondary is DEPLOY_FROZEN repo variable

## Production Incidents

### 2026-03-22: API ActivationFailed (issue #217, resolved)
- **Root cause:** `AzureBlobStorage--ConnectionString` secret missing from Key Vault.
- **Lesson:** When adding a service that reads from Key Vault, ensure the secret is provisioned.
